# Junction Engine Backend API

## Getting Started

Clone the repoistory. Make sure you have Go installed. On MacOS, you can use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install go
```

If you don't have Go installed, you can download it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/). You will also want to install [Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) for hot-reloading during development.

```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Run a hot-reloading development server
make dev
```
